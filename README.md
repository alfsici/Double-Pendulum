Double-Pendulum
===============

This repository contains two files: a Maya scene containing a basic double pendulum, and a python script designed to 
interact with it. The script and scene work together, and using the hierarchy designed in the scene the script
is able to simulate the motion of a double pendulum. The simulation can be run using Euler and RK4, and new materials can 
be added at your leisure.
